# Mochi 2.0
_Front-end framework for developing responsive, mobile-first projects on the web or offline._

> [**v2.0.0**](https://github.com/codeworksdev/mochi-2.0/releases/latest)

Mochi 2.0 is a ready-to-deploy HTML5 boilerplate framework that runs on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), but adds tons of new features, with a strong focus on offline web applications without all the limitations. It achieves this goal by fully integrating and maintaining offline versions of popular libraries that have been out in the wild for years.

## What is Bootstrap?
[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Quickly prototype your ideas or build your entire app with powerful [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful plugins built on [jQuery](https://jquery.com/). Mochi 2.0 takes this a few steps further by enabling functionality that would normally require many hours of code writing and head-scratching. More information on Bootstrap [here](http://getbootstrap.com/).

## Usage
To use Mochi, simply [download the latest distribution package](https://github.com/codeworksdev/mochi-2.0/releases/latest) and extract the contents of the included **`dist`** folder to the root of your website directory (e.g., **`/var/www/html`** in some systems). That's it! You now have a fully functioning, Bootstrap-powered boilerplate web application framework installed on your website. Mochi 2.0 is designed to run either online or offline, depending on your desired configuration (more on that later).

The included HTML starter template ([**`dist/index.html`**](https://github.com/codeworksdev/mochi-2.0/blob/master/dist/index.html)) is a great way to get started with using Mochi 2.0. Because it's powered by Bootstrap you can do a bunch of things right out of the box, and with minimal effort. Check out the [official Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/) to learn more about how to structure your HTML/CSS markup according to the latest web standards.
